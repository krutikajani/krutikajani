Hi I am Krutika.
I completed my Masters in computers with a specialisation in cloud computing in 2017.
My academic journey provided me with a theoretical foundation, but my real coding adventure began when I started exploring hands-on projects and delving into the practical aspects of programming.
After completing my Masters, I chose the teaching field and joined one of the engineering colleges as a lecturer. During my career in academics, I have to invite various industry experts to my college to share their industry experiences with students. 
From there, slowly and gradually, I started developing an interest in industrial work. In spite of having more than 7 years of experience in academics, I decided to restart my career in the IT industry with my passion for programming technologies and software development. 
Working in entry-level roles to kick-start my career in the IT industry also helped me settle in smoothly!
Gradually, I ended up working for a government organization in the role of Platform Engineer. 
What truly motivates me about software industry is its power to transform ideas into tangible solutions. I find joy in the problem-solving aspect of programming, automation and technologies, and I'm always eager to embrace new technologies and methodologies that can enhance my skills.
I am excited about the prospect of learning and collaborating with like-minded peers and gaining real-world experience through the organisation's practical components.
